But you only have enough budget to\ninstall sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall\ntraffic?\n\nBased on the data that was given, we calculated the percentage of traffic that goes through each bridge every single day, then we took the average of total sum of each bridge's percentage. \nIn the end, our data indicated that the lowest percentage of traffic was flowing through Brooklyn Bridge, therefore, we recommend installing sensors to Manhattan, Williamsburg, Queensboro Bridges.\n\n2- The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand\nout citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast to predict the number of bicyclists that day?\n\n\nApproaching this question with logic, and without any data analysis, our answer would be yes, the next day's weather could help us predict the number of bicyclists that day. \nIn order to understand whether our logical approach correlates with our data analysis, we used linear regression with 5-degree polynomials based on the independent variables that we had mentioned in our introduction. We will also use linear regression to find the MSE and R squared values at best-fit lambda based on our predicted model.\n\n3- Can you use this data to predict whether it is raining based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?\n\nAgain, logically, the number of bicyclists is dependent on an enormous scale of factors, due to this it would be very hard to find a concrete relationship between whether it is raining or not and the number of bikers out that day.  \n\nRegardless, we will still do our data analysis using two regression models. Our first method will be linear regression with a similar approach to what we had made in question 2. Our second model will be random forest regression with correlation of the MSE and R values."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our data in Path 1, NYC_Bicycle_Counts_2016_Corrected.csv,  gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City.
